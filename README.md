# multisig-wallet
A multi sig wallet that would allow users to create and manage their shared treasury.

The smart contract would allow you to 
- create a treasury for your DAO with a threshold and some minimum members.
- can carry out proposals for adding, removing, changing threshold, changing time limit through the process of voting where the threshold has to be reached.
- can transfer the amount from treasury if threshold number of members sign
- can perform shutdown if the members are inactive where the threshold decreases every couple of days until it reaches 1.
